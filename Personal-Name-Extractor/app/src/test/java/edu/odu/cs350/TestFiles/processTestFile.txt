<NER> Oh Diseases ran rampant in the 1900s affecting the health and safety of the public as a whole. Most of these diseases were found to be communicable diseases that could be prevented by proper sanitation standards. This was around when the first public health laboratory opened and began to study epidemiology to prevent disease (Bloomberg and Frieden, 2005). In New York City, typhoid was prominent in 1900-1920 as exhibited in the well publicized case of Mary Mallon. The case of “Typhoid-Mary'' significantly impacted the New York City Department of Health  in the early 20th century and the approach to medicine with asymptomatic carriers of disease.
Mary Mallon was an Irish immigrant born in 1869, and came to America as a teenager (Connolly, 2020). Mary worked as a cook for eight wealthy families in New York including Henry Gilsey, Mr. Coleman Drayton, and Charles Henry Warren (Connolly, 2020) (Marineli et. all, 2013) ("George Soper on Mary Mallon"). During the span of her employment with each of these families, seven out of eight households contracted typhoid including their families and associated staff ("George Soper on Mary Mallon"). Between these households, 38 people were affected (Bradshaw, 1907). Despite Mary Mallon’s lack of symptoms, the string of cases left in her wake with each family raised the suspicions of Charles Henry Warren; in 1906 he enlisted Dr. George Soper, a sanitation engineer from the Department of Health, to investigate the connection (Bradshaw, 1907) ("George Soper on Mary Mallon")("Typhoid Mary: Topics in Chronicling America") (Bushel, 1966). Dr. Soper concluded that Mary Mallon was the source of the typhoid infections in these families ("Typhoid Mary: Topics in Chronicling America'') (Bushel, 1966). At this point, the New York City Department of Health began to supervise typhoid carriers (Bushel, 1966).
In response to the discovery of Mary’s connection to these typhoid cases, the New York City Department of Health under the Greater New York Charter promptly sent her to quarantine at North Brother Island (Connolly, 2020). Riverside Hospital on North Brother Island was utilized to quarantine abnormal carriers of typhoid such as Mary Mallon ("Typhoid Mary: Topics in Chronicling America"). Upon her arrival at Riverside Hospital she was constantly subjected to extensive testing (Mallon, 1909). According to a letter Mary later wrote to the editor of the American, she claimed that the doctors at Riverside took frequent blood samples and collected feces once a week for testing and depicted that the patients were subjected to harsh, inhumane living conditions (Mallon, 1909). Additionally, she was administered several experimental treatments via medication; these medications under long term use were potentially fatal and the attempts futile (Mallon, 1909) (Bradshaw, 1907). She was wholeheartedly under the belief that the hospital and New York City Department of Health was unreasonably denying her release. Mary insisted that she was unrightfully confined under the belief that she as well as the others on the island couldn’t have typhoid due to their lack of symptoms (Mallon, 1909). Under habeas corpus Mary Mallon attempted to sue</NER> <NER>the New York City Department of Health and be released from her unrightful confinement ("Typhoid Mary: Topics in Chronicling America"). Needless to say, in 1911 she lost the lawsuit and remained at Riverside Hospital ("Typhoid Mary: Topics in Chronicling America"). Soon after she was denied release a new health commissioner vowed to free Mary from her confinement and pushed for her release. After several years of her confinement she was granted a conditional release: Mary was allowed release under the condition that she would never work as a cook again to prevent further spread of typhoid ("Typhoid Mary: Topics in Chronicling America") (Bloomberg and Frieden, 2005). A few years later Mary Mallon began working under an alias as a cook in a hospital; it was suggested that she infected up to 50 more people with the virus; then promptly sent back to isolation in 1915 ("Typhoid Mary: Topics in Chronicling America") (Marineli et. all, 2013).
The media portrayed Mary as crazy and monstrous because she was rumored to have attacked doctors and continuously refused treatments while under the control of the New York City Department of Health (Bradshaw, 1907). The media coined her nickname “Typhoid-Mary” and became synonymous with the spread of disease (Marineli et. all, 2013). Over 400 other individuals were identified as asymptomatic carriers of typhoid, however they were never as victimized or put on public display the same way Mary Mallon was (Marineli et. all, 2013). It was found that the cause of Typhoid was lack of general sanitation and clean water which encouraged the implementation and enforcement of vigorous sanitation efforts by the Department of Health (Connolly, 2020) (Bushel, 1966). Some of these sanitation standards included standards for children, schools, water, milk, etc. (Bushel, 1966). The New York Department of Health began its deep dive into epidemiology due to the case of Typhoid Mary (Institute of Medicine (US) Committee for the Study of the Future of Public Health, 1988).
Overall, the case of Typhoid-Mary had a significant impact on the Department of Health and the early 1900s. The Department of Health saw how communicable diseases in the hands of an asymptomatic carrier could wreak havoc and were extremely dangerous and therefore set up standards to prevent further spread of disease. They concluded that it was a public responsibility for health and that it includes both environmental sanitation and individual health (Institute of Medicine (US) Committee for the Study of the Future of Public Health, 1988). This furthered the New York Department of Health’s deep dive into epidemiology (Institute of Medicine (US) Committee for the Study of the Future of Public Health, 1988). The case of Typhoid-Mary, the asymptomatic carrier, has had a direct effect on the way we treat asymptomatic carriers with COVID-19. It instilled the practice of quarantining individuals who do not exhibit symptoms and the tracking of the spread of disease by the  Department of Health (Connolly, 2020) (Bloomberg and Frieden, 2005). We should heed the warning of Typhoid-Mary’s case of the asymptomatic carrier.</NER>
<NER>Virtual reality is a fully immersive simulation; augmented reality (AR) and visual interactive reality are subclasses of the term virtual reality (VR) ("Augmented Reality," 2020). The use of the different forms of VR has made a significant difference in the medical field as a whole. Although virtual reality is useful in many fields, it possesses significant differences between each field. The main differences between their use in each field is the necessary software for their intended applications. In the surgical field, virtual reality has the ability to be utilized in pain management, medical training, surgical planning, and telesurgery. The use of virtual reality in a medical setting has increased the capabilities and efficiency of surgeons.
There is a high potential for the use of virtual reality in pain management.
Based on the assumption that “the perception of pain has a large psychological component”, a person’s pain level can be manipulated by adding additional stimuli during cases of acute pain reducing pain killer dosages (Shetty, 2019). Therefore, if the psychological component is stimulated by other factors than the anticipation of the pain, the overall pain perception is significantly lower (Shetty, 2019). Virtual Reality Hypnosis (VRH) hinges on this assumption of pain perception; utilizing virtual reality equipment, additional stimuli are added to include sensory details including various sounds, colors, apparent motion (Li et al., 2017). Despite the promising results thus far, there is still an insufficient amount of research to make solid conclusions as to the effectiveness of virtual reality hypnosis (Li et al., 2017).
One case study observed the effect of virtual reality hypnosis during minor oral surgeries; it focused on the perceived pain levels of five to eight year olds using a control group and a group of children that utilized VRH (Shetty, 2019). Higher physical stress levels occur as pain perception increases; this is inversely proportional to salivary cortisol levels (Shetty, 2019).  The study concluded that the use of virtual reality hypnosis decreased the child’s salivary cortisol and stress levels; therefore, their pain perception was much lower compared to the control group and afterwards each group experienced the same level of residual pain (Shetty, 2019). 
Graph 1. Recorded the salivary cortisol levels of the experimental and control groups of children before, during, and after their procedures. The averages are depicted; the levels are lower during the experimental group’s procedure. Therefore, the stress levels displayed in group two were higher than those of the control group (Shetty, 2019).
Their pain perceptions were also confirmed by their testimonials, concluding that VRH reduced the children’s perceived pain (Shetty, 2019). Less pain allows for more energy and focus on procedures rather than adjusting their actions based on the patient's perceived pain levels.
Due to the recent increase in medical students, there are more limitations to hands-on experiences for trainees than in the past due to the high costs, decreased training hours, and ethical concerns for a patients safety; however, only observing procedures is no longer adequate, especially for special techniques (Li et al., </NER><NER> 2017). Virtual reality provides another form of hands on experience that  is much less costly, time consuming, and safer for students to practice before being included in conducting real operations (Li et al., 2017). Currently, the difficult field of laparoscopic training utilizes VR to avoid potentially risky situations for patients (Li et al., 2017). For instances when students still require observational studies, telesurgery equipment allows students to see more detailed diagrams and images in real time using the equipment’s VR and AR capabilities (Davis et al., 2015).
Detailed simulations are able to exhibit the complexity of anatomic structures and allows students to inspect each element of the simulation (Li et al., 2017). Additionally, it allows students to participate in artificial surgeries and numerically scored based on their precision as well as indicate areas that require improvement; each adds to their hands on learning before moving to the operating room (Li et al., 2017). They are able to simulate feelings during the simulation, such as the reaming of bones was able to be reproduced by the TraumaVision VR simulator; this allows for an easier transition from simulation to surgery (Li et al., 2017). During the more advanced stages of surgical training, the use of VR has produced surgeons with more accuracy, better precision that prevents injury and damaged tissue, and faster surgical procedures (Li et al., 2017). These trainees get more hands on training than those in a traditional classroom making them more competent from the start due to their better understanding from the ability to conduct risk free VR produced surgeries (Li et al., 2017). However, currently the only VR surgical training system is VRMagic’s EYESI; it’s main focus is ophthalmic surgery (Li et al., 2017). 
For experienced surgeons virtual reality’s ability to analyze and implement quantitative data on a patient’s condition as well as every movement in a simulated procedure allows for surgeons to also utilize these parameters to determine the most likely outcomes of a specific course of action (Li et al., 2017). They are able to upload their definite knowledge from tests such as MRIs and CT scans, forming a patient specific simulation; this allows them to run tests straying from their definite knowledge through several possibilities before a procedure (Li et al., 2017). For example, MRIs and CT scans can give a surgeon a general idea of how they should proceed, however sometimes there are unknowns. The surgeon may not know exactly how large a fatty tumor is that they are trying to remove; surgeons can then run simulations with different extents of its size and how its size could impact the procedure, changing their course of action. Carnegie Mellon has utilized the idea of patient specific VR projections; the HipNave was developed to predict the range of motion, bone motion, and the best placement of hip implants before surgery (Li et al., 2017).
Telesurgery eliminates time, geographical, and physical limitations; it allows for superior surgical intervention (Choi et al., 2018). Furthermore, it compensates for the</NER> <NER>shortage of surgeons around the world; it is projected that in 2032, the US will be short 23,000 surgeons (Haskins, 2019). The beauty of telesurgery is the use of virtual interactive presence (VIP); it allows for simultaneous actions and smooth transitions between multiple surgeons through the system’s shared 3D HD system allowing for effective collaboration despite the distance between surgeons. The VIP completely eliminates the geographical barriers. It is capable of compensating for physical barriers as well; it is capable of canceling out a surgeon's tremors in real time. This prevents damage to healthy tissue, in turn decreasing patient recovery time (Choi et al., 2018). Virtual Interactive presence allows surgeons to see each other's motions in real time. This technology was used to carry out successful pterional and suboccipital craniotomies (Choi et al., 2018). This allows local surgeons in training to perform surgeries with specialists to improve their skills and gain experience while remaining in their own country (Davis et al., 2015). In 2015 the Telelap Alf-X was the first prototype to provide haptic feedback; it allowed the surgeons to feel the resistance and sensations of using the tools during surgery,this led to reduced time in surgery (Choi et al., 2018).
The only physical issue with the VIP is the mean latency-time of 760 ± 606 milliseconds; it doesn’t seem very large, but it still requires further optimization before it will be accepted widespread for a larger variety of surgeries (Choi et al., 2018).There are several other aspects preventing the accepted use of telesurgery: the lack of training programs, difficulty obtaining the equipment, billing issues between medical centers, funding, and legality across state borders (Choi et al., 2018).  Current telesurgery technology (the VIP) can remotely make movements with sub-millimeter precision and allows the surgeons participating to communicate and get visual information in real time during the procedure including haptic feedback; overall, this improves the safety and efficiency of each surgery (Davis et al., 2015).
The surgical field will transform with the widespread implementation of virtual reality. If more research is found it will allow surgeons to focus more on the procedure rather than adjusting and compensating for a patient's perceived psychological pain. Virtual and augmented reality simulations give a more effective in depth understanding during a surgeon’s training producing more competent surgeons. Presurgical planning with patient specific simulation allows for better understanding of each patient’s situation before a procedure. The use of virtual interactive presence eliminates traditional barriers, improves precision, and compensates for the growing shortage of surgeons throughout the world. Overall, virtual reality allows surgeons to increase their hands on training, more comprehensive understanding before each procedure, more energy to focus on the task at hand, and perform surgeries anywhere. The use of VR has improved the efficiency of today's surgeons; widespread use of VR in the surgical field will provide endless possibilities for patients and surgeons alike due to the improved efficiency and capabilities of surgeons.
